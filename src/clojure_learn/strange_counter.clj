; The first step is to identify which countdown sequence t belongs to
; So we need to find  3 + 6 + 12 + â€¦. such that is it just greater than t
;
; For example:
; With t = 15
; 3 + 6 + 12 is just larger than 15, so its part of the 3rd sequence
;
; This is a geometric sequence with a = 3 and r = 2
; Given g(n) = a ( 1 - r^n ) / ( 1 - r ) = 3*( 2^n - 1 )
; g(N) <= t < g(N+1)
;
; t > 3*(2^N - 1 ) => n = log 2 ( t/3 + 1 )
